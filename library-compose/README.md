# Jetpack Compose support

[Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3fVBPwn0qPY2gE7Ghqy3N3sT1cZa2CQ4luSD5VgiCRZ5UHNQN0Ao2gaAmPrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) is a toolkit to develop native UI in Android. Newer and more powerful than Android Views it has became the default system in newer TelefÃ³nica Android applications.

## Installation

Inside the dependency block in the `build.gradle` of your application, add this line to add the library:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.telefonica:mistica-compose:$version'
    ...
}
```


In case you also want to include also the components catalog in your application:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.telefonica:mistica-compose:$version'
    implementation 'com.telefonica:mistica-compose-catalog:$version'
    ...
}
```

## Configuration
The goal of the team is to provide a fully compose implementation of the library, but currently there are still wrapped views inside `AndroidView` composables. So it is still needed to add [the brand theme in the Manifest](../README.md#configuration)

Also, wrap your outer composable with the `MisticaTheme`

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MisticaTheme(
    brand: Brand,
    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(),
    content: @Composable () -> Unit,
)
```

where `brand` is the implementation of the app brand and `darkTheme` a flag that indicates if the theme should be dark or light. Example:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            MisticaTheme(brand = MovistarBrand) {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
```
