### ü§ñ Copilot review
@copilot Please review this PR for potential breaking changes in the public API **within the `library` module only**.

Focus on:
- Public classes, interfaces, methods, or properties that are renamed, removed, or modified.
- Changes in method signatures (parameters, return types).
- Visibility changes (e.g., public ‚Üí protected/private).
- Enum value removals.

Review all modified files in the `library` module and comment on each breaking change.
