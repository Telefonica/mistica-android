### ü§ñ Copilot review
@copilot Please review this PR for potential breaking changes in the public API **within the `library` module only**.

Focus on:
- Removed or renamed public classes, interfaces, enums, methods, properties, or constants.
- Changes in method signatures (parameters, return types).
- Visibility changes (e.g., public ‚Üí protected/private/package-private).
- Enum value removals.
- Removal of public annotations or change of annotation values (e.g., @JvmOverloads, @Deprecated).
- Behavioral changes that keep the signature but alter the contract (e.g., new exceptions thrown, different return values for same input).

Review all modified files in the `library` module and comment on each breaking change.
